You've (somehow) managed to stumble upon my dark corner on the internet.[^1]

## Who am I?
I've always enjoyed writing code and solving problems, but I learned early in my career that I didn't want to be a full-time programmer. So I instead spent years as a system administrator, first with Windows and Linux servers and then a focus on virtualization. Along the way, I still flexed my coding muscles by writing scripts and tools to help me work more efficiently.




I'm a part of a small *Platforms Engineering* team inside a large corporation. We preach the Good Word of *DevSecOps* and help our internal customers modernize the way they build, deploy, and ship products.
