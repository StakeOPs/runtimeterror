You've (somehow) managed to stumble upon my dark corner on the internet.[^1]

## Who am I?
I've always enjoyed writing code and solving problems, but learned early in my career that I didn't want to be a full-time programmer. So I spent many years administering virtual systems and their supporting infrastructure, while writing scripts to help automate the management of those systems.


I'm a part of a small *Platforms Engineering* team inside a large corporation. We preach the Good Word of *DevSecOps* and help our internal customers modernize the way they build, deploy, and ship products.

[^1]: Congrats?
