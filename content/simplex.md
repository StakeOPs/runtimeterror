[SimpleX Chat](https://simplex.chat/) is a secure messaging solution with a strong emphasis on user privacy. It's (naturally) end-to-end encrypted, doesn't require (or collect) *any* information about you in order to sign up, doesn't use any persistent user identifiers (not even a randomly-generated one), is fully decentralized, and is *not* affiliated with any cryptocurrency project/scam.

Incoming messages are routed through a pool of servers so that your conversations don't all follow the same path - and no server knows anything about conversations that aren't routed through it. Servers only hold your messages long enough to ensure they get to you, and those messages exist only in the encrypted database on your device once they've been delivered. (Fortunately, SimpleX makes it easy to back up that database and restore it on a new device so you don't lose any messages or contacts.)

The app is also packed with other features like disappearing messages, encrypted file transfers, encrypted voice messages, encrypted audio and video calls, decentralized private groups, and a cool incognito mode which connects new conversations to a randomly-generated profile instead of your primary one. There's even a [CLI client](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/docs/CLI.md)!
