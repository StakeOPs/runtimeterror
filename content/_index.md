<h1 style="color: var(--base08)"> Error 0xdeadbeef: Quantum Entanglement Overflow Exception</h1>

The quantum realm has spewed forth a turbulent overflow of entangled particles, causing an unprecedented disruption in the fabric of our digital universe. Your innocuous request has inadvertently triggered this calamity, resulting in a cataclysmic violation of the space-time continuum. It seems the very laws of physics are in revolt, and we apologize for the cosmic inconvenience.

## Possible Causes
1. Unforeseen cosmic interference during data transmission.
2. Intense gravitational fluctuations induced by a black hole nearby.
3. Momentary misalignment of subatomic particles within your device.
4. Temporary rip in the space-time continuum caused by a coffee spill.

## Recommended Actions
1. Attempt a ritualistic dance to appease the quantum deities and restore balance.
2. Recite the digits of Pi to at least a thousand decimal places while spinning clockwise.
3. Sacrifice a can of Red Bull to the code gods to energize the electrons.
4. Consult a quantum physicist or metaphysical guru to meditate on the enigma.
