I spend a lot of my time and energy answering technical questions[^1]. How a question is asked plays a big factor in how effectively I'll be able to answer it. Years ago I came across Eric Steven Raymond's [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) and it really resonated with me. I wish everyone would read it before asking for technical help but I recognize it's a pretty large doc at this point. So I thought I'd summarize some of the main points that I would like to emphasize.

## Know Who You're Asking
The sorts of people who choose to spend their time answering questions do it because they truly enjoy helping others. They thrive on interesting and challenging questions... but they're also busy, so may filter or pass over questions that don't seem as interesting. If your question or issue really is a tricky one, you need to take steps to communicate that.

> Good questions are a stimulus and a gift.

## Research Before You Ask
One of the best ways to demonstrate that your question poses an interesting challenge is to show that you've already put in some effort on your part. Search the web, read the documentation, and try to find the answer on your own. If you're still stuck, mention what you've already tried and why it didn't help. Show that you've already invested some time and energy into solving the problem yourself and you'll be more likely to get a response.

## Clear and Specific Subject Line
The subject line is your best chance to get someone to look at your question. If you're posting on a help forum, it's understood that you're seeking assistance; you don't need to put "help" anywhere in the subject line. Instead, use that space to clearly describe the problem you're facing, including any specific devices or software involved.

## Correct Spelling and Grammar
We need to understand what you're trying to ask before we can answer it, and that's hard to do if your question is loaded with typos and mistakes. It doesn't have to be perfect, but *please* make an effort. Once you've written your query, take the time to read back over it and make sure it makes sense. This is another chance to show us that you're serious about solving the problem.

{{% notice tip %}}If you're posting on an English-language forum and you're not comfortable communicating in English, you might try using an online translation tool to help write your question. In that case, please also mention that you used a translation tool so that we can be more understanding of any irregular grammar or phrasing.

## Be Precise
Generally speaking, the more detail you can provide about your problem, the better.

- What system/device are you using? Be specific about the model and/or version.
- What are the symptoms of the problem? Are there any error messages? If so, include those *in full*.
- When did the problem start? Is this a new problem or has it never worked? What (if anything) changed before the problem started?
- What steps have you already taken to try and solve the problem? Don't say "I've tried everything" (which tells us nothing); tell us *exactly* what you've tried.

## Describe the Symptoms, Not Your Guesses
If you're not sure what's causing the problem, don't guess. Sharing a guess which isn't correct can lead people down the wrong path and waste everyone's time. Focus instead on accurately describing the symptoms and leave the diagnosis to the kind souls trying to help you.

## Describe the Goal, Not the Step
Similarly, when trying to accomplish a particular goal, share that goal rather than just focusing on the step you're trying to take. It's easy to get fixated on a small step (which may or may not be the correct one to take) and miss the better solution.

## Be Explicit About Your Question

## Be Courteous
