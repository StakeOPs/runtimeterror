I spend a lot of my time and energy answering technical questions[^1]. How a question is asked plays a big factor in how effectively I'll be able to answer it. Years ago I came across Eric Steven Raymond's [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) and it really resonated with me. I wish everyone would read it before asking for technical help but I recognize it's a pretty large doc at this point. So I thought I'd summarize some of the main points that I would like to emphasize.

## Research Before You Ask

## Clear and Specific Subject Line

## Correct Spelling and Grammar

## Be Precise

## ...But Not Unnecessarily Verbose

## Describe the Symptoms, Not Your Guesses

## Describe the Goal, Not the Step

## Be Explicit About Your Question

## Be Courteous

## Follow Up with Solution
